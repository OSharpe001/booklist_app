# **USER STORY**

## US1: As a user, when I click the "Add Book" button before filling out all fields, I expect to see an error alert and NOT have my input info saved.

## US2: As a user, if I previously recieved an error, I expect not to see much more (if any) upon further errors.

## US3: As a user, I expect error messages to not remain on my screen for an extended period of time, especially after correcting my error.

## US4: As a user, when I click the "Add Book" button (after filling in all fields), I expect to see a new insert (with all my input info) appear in the table below the submit ("Add Book") button.

## US5: As a user, when I click the "Add Book" button (after filling in all fields), I expect to see all of the info in the input fields disappear, allowing me to easily input another entry.

## US6: As a user, when I click the "x" button (delete) in the table row of a particular book entry, I expect to see that particular entry disappear from the table.

## US7: As a user, if I were to close or refresh my browser, I would expect to see all my previously saved books info return to the table.
